Practical 1 : 

The objective here is to practically compare the running time of sorting algorithms. The files insert1.cpp and qsort-copy.cpp are implementations
of insertions sort and quick sort algorithm. The numbers to be sorted are generated by using random number generator function rand().

Your task:
  1. Generate as many as numbers possible (at least up to the point where you can actually note the running time (more than 5 seconds for quick sort)) 
    using  the for loop and then sort the numbers. Note the time taken untile final output by both programs.
    
  2. Repeat task 1. This time instead of noting the time manually, modify the programs to automatically calculate the sorting time. 
     (hint: Use c/c++ API to compute system time before starting sorting and after finishing sorting.)
